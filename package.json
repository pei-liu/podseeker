  "description": "## Project Description As a podcast consumer, I subscribe to podcasts that I listen to on a regular basis. However, sometimes I desire to search for individual podcast *episodes*, based on a keyword, regardless of whether that episode is from a podcast I'm subscribed to. This way I can better discover new podcasts that are about things I'm interested in. The system I'm designing will first fetch podcast metadata from public RSS feeds (almost all podcasts have one because it is required to get onto apps such as Apple Podcasts) and parse each episodes' metadata (title, description, transcript). Second, it will analyze this data to create an inverted index for searching. Finally, there will be a search engine UI where the user can enter a keyword and see a list of recent podcast episodes (across different podcast series) related to that keyword. This product is unique because while there are many sites that allow you to find podcast series by topic, I couldn't find anything that allows you find episodes by topic.",
